Girl, I always pictured it'd be pourin' down rain
With old Hank singin' some song about trains
And midnight taillights tearing down a highway
Or some other heartbroke cliché
But there's nothin' but blue skies as far as I can see
You picked a damn good day to leave me
Sittin' here, cooler full of Keystone
Nothing to do but fish all day long
A pocket full of three-day weekend money
Ain't a heartbreak cloud in the forecast, honey
I hate to see you go but if you ask me
You picked a damn good day to leave
Well, how in the hell can I watch the big game
Without me having you here to complain?
And how am I gonna do anything now
Without you here telling me how?
Guess it could be worse, hell, it's seventy-five degrees
You picked a damn good day to leave me
Sittin' here, cooler full of Keystone
Nothing to do but fish all day long
A pocket full of three-day weekend money
Ain't a heartbreak cloud in the forecast, honey
I hate to see you go but if you ask me
You picked a damn good day to leave
No doubt
A damn good day to leave
I guess I'll miss the Bachelorette
Well, what a shame
But Channel 8's about to marathon John Wayne
You picked a damn good day to leave me
Sittin' here, cooler full of Keystone
Nothing to do but fish all day long
A pocket full of three-day weekend money
Ain't a heartbreak cloud in the forecast, honey
I hate to see you go but if you ask me
You picked a damn good day to leave
Yeah, it was a mighty fine day to leave
